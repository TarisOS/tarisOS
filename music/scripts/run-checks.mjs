/**
 * Runs every `*.check.ts` self-check in the repo.
 *
 * These files carried their own esbuild incantation in a header comment, which meant they
 * only ever ran when someone remembered to paste it — fifteen files of real assertions that
 * nothing executed. This is the thing that executes them.
 *
 *   npm run check
 *
 * Bundling goes through esbuild's JS API rather than the `esbuild` binary: on Windows that
 * binary is reached through a `.cmd` shim, and Node refuses to spawn one without a shell
 * (CVE-2024-27980), while spawning *with* a shell concatenates arguments instead of passing
 * them. The API sidesteps both and skips a process per check.
