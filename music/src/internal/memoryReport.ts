 * A memory line in the app log, once a minute.
 *
 * Task Manager says the renderer is using 220 MB and stops there. That number is the sum of at
 * least four things that are fixed in completely different ways, and picking the wrong one is
 * how an afternoon disappears:
 *
 * - **JS heap** — retained objects. Grows over a session if something is leaking references.
 * - **DOM nodes** — these lists are not windowed, so a long playlist really does build every
 *   row. Nodes carry style and layout objects whether or not they are on screen.
 * - **Images** — the big one, and the least obvious: a decoded bitmap is ~4 bytes per pixel
 *   regardless of how small the JPEG was, so one full-size cover in a 40px slot costs more than
 *   two hundred correctly-sized ones.
 * - **Subframes** — each YouTube IFrame player is its own renderer, around 90 MB of it.
 *
 * One sample a minute is nothing next to what it replaces, and the shape over a session is what
 * actually identifies the culprit: a flat line with a high floor is not a leak, and a staircase
 * that climbs as you browse is not a baseline.

 * to open a thousand-track playlist, scroll it, and navigate away again entirely unobserved.
 *
